### GA
- Poisson distribution:
    - P(X=x)= e  <sup>-y</sup> y  <sup>x</sup> / x!

- Number of rectangles in a grid:
    - `m C`<sub>`2`</sub>`X n C`<sub>`2`</sub> 
    - *where m - no of horizontal lines, n - no of vertical lines*
    - *Eg: 2x4 grid, m=3,n=5*
- *Shri's techniques:*
    - ***if grid is square,*** squares is square formula, rectangle is cube formula
    - ***if grid is rectangle,*** squares a reduction technique, *Eg. 2x4: n=2x4 +1x3*
### Computer Science
#### DS
- **Full Binary Tree** A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary** - As left as possible (heap)
- **Perfect Binary** - Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
- ***BST Deletion***: Case when both left and right child is there, Inorder successor is always either a *leaf node or a node with empty left child*
#### Algorithms:
- ***Matrix Multiplication:*** Two matrices A and B of order `l x m `and `m x n` respectively, then the number of scalar multiplications is `l x m x n`
>- *Note: Minimise using DP algo and associativity*
#### Compiler Design
- Tokens: '100' is a single token
#### Operating Systems
- **User and Kernel Threads**: 
- **Disk Scheduling**:
- **Throughput and Waiting time - Scheduling**:
- **TLB Cache AMAT**:
#### Networks:
- ***Parity error detection*** - Single Parity Error:
>- If total number of 1’s is even and even parity is used, then receiver assumes that no error occurred.
>- If total number of 1’s is even and odd parity is used, then receiver assumes that error occurred.
>- If total number of 1’s is odd and odd parity is used, then receiver assumes that no error occurred.
>- If total number of 1’s is odd and even parity is used, then receiver assumes that error occurred.

#### Engineering Math:
- ***Calculus:*** Stationary Point -
