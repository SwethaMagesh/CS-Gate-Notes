### Points to remember
- Overflow condition is add two numbers of same sign and get a different signed answer.

### Some Formulae
-  CPU Execution Time =    `Instruction/prgm * CPI * Clock cycle time`
- CPI = `CPU clock cycles/ inst + Memory clock cycles / inst`
- Memory clock cycle / inst =   ` Mem ref per instruction * Miss rate * Miss penalty`

- *NOTE:*
- ODD PARITY - XOR (Async Serial communication)
