## Algorithms
- Complexity of algorithms
- Dynamic programming  = LCS, Matrix multiplication
- Graph traversals, MST
- Quick sort, Merge sort
## DS and C programming
- AVL and BST
- Stack applications - prefix, postfix n so on
- Static variables 
- Pointers
- Arrays, Linked list
## Models important
- Find postorder given inorder, preorder
- LCS and Matrix Mul
- Swaps in sorting and also which has least swaps n so on
- Average number of comparisons by merge sort
- Maximum height possible in BST and AVL
