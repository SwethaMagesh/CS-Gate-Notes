## Divisibility rules 
### 2 to 11
- Rules
###  <span style="color:blue">Prime numbers
- *to check out*
### Composite numbers 
- Divide into 2 coprimes and check them
---
## *a<sup>n</sup>* - *b<sup>n</sup>*
- Is atleast divisible by `(a-b)`
- If n is ***even***, it is even divisible by `(a+b)(a-b)`
## *a<sup>m</sup>* + *b<sup>n</sup>*
- Is always divisible by `GCD(a,b)`
- *Eg: 333<sup>555</sup>+ 555<sup>333</sup> is always divisible by 111 and hence 37, and also by 3. Since, both terms are odd, also divisible by 2.*
---
## Power cycle 
- Last digit of *a<sup>n</sup>*
## Remainder cycle 
- Remainder when *a<sup>n</sup>* is divided by b
##  <span style="color:blue">Chinese Remainder Theorem
- *to check out*
### Note:
- *For 5 alone remainder cycle not needed, last digit is sufficient*

## Highest power of a in b!
### Prime number 
### Composite number 
- Factorise
- ***Application***: Number of zeros in a! - *Find the highest power of 10*
### Powers of prime 
- Eg 8

## Number theory - Combinatorics
- Number of factors of a number from prime factorisation
- Sum of factors of a number 
- Number of factors of a number which are ***perfect squares***
    - Small modification of number of factors.

## LCM, GCD of fractions
- Numerator, Denominator separately.
## Applications of GCD, LCM
- Greatest, least number exactly divisible by a,b,c
- Greatest, least number divisible by a,b,c leaving same remainder
    - Greatest - `GCD(a-b,b-c,c-a)`
    - Least    - `LCM(a,b,c) + r`  *if r not smaller than a,b and c*
- Greatest, least number divisible by a,b,c leaving rem x,y,z
    - Greatest - `GCD(a-x,b-y,c-z)`
    - Least    - `LCM(a,b,c) - r` *only if r=a-x=b-y=c-z*
---
## NOTE:
- *Different Model: Successively dividing in order to give remainders a,b,c respectively.*
- Quotient is divided as a chain until specified.
