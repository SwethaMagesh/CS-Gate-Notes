## Fundamental Counting Principle
- AND
- OR
## Permutation and Combination
- Permutation - Selection and Arrangement
- Combination - Selection only
- Circular Permutation
    -`(n-1)!`
    - Divide by 2 if symmetric from *anticlockwise and clockwise*
## Notes:
- Post n letters in k postboxes =>  **k<sup>n</sup>**
    - n rings in k fingers
    - n balls in k boxes
- *Atleast one: All ways - Ways where none of it is there*
- *Lines, triangles and point of intersection*
    1. n points, out of which k points collinear
    - **Lines=** ***`nC2 - kC2 + 1`***
    - **Triangles=**  ***`nC3 - kC3`***
    2. n lines, out of which k are concurrent
    - **Points of intersection=** ***`nC2 - kC2 + 1`***
    - *Note*: Incase of parallel, don't add that one as concurrent
- *Put n identical objects into k distinguishable boxes* :  
    - *Also for finding integer solution*
    - ***`(n+k-1)Cn`***
- *Put n identical objects into k identical boxes:* Partition:
	1. 3 into 2 : 3, 1+2 - 2 ways
	1. 4 into 3 : 4, 1+3, 2+2, 1+1+2 - 4 ways
- *Stirling summation for n distinguishable in k indistinguishable boxes: like identical branches of company recruiting n diff people*:
