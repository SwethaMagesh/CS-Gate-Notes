## Ratio
- Comparison between similar quantities
- Only if units of measurement is same
## Zigzag 
- Shortcut instead of multiplying after finding LCM
## Proportion
- a,b,c and d in proportion if `a:b::c:d` ie. ad=bc
## Continued Proportion
- a,b,c are in continued proportion if `a:b::b:c`
---
## Variation - Direct and Inverse
- Directly proportional => `x/y is proportionality constant` 
- Invesely proportional => `xy is proportionality constant` 
---
## Linear Equations 
- Dependent equations - infinite solutions
- Inconsistent
- Independent equations and consistent - Unique solutions
- Methods to solve: 
    - Substitution
    - Elimination
    - Add and sub (very easy and time saving) => when x and y coefficient exchanged
## Ages problem, Coins problem etc. 
- *n years hence - add n to both the person's age*
- Frame an equation correctly and solve it
