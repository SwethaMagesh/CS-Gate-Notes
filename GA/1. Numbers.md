- *to check out*
### Composite numbers 
- Divide into 2 coprimes and check them
---
## *a<sup>n</sup>* - *b<sup>n</sup>*
- Is atleast divisible by `(a-b)`
- If n is ***even***, it is even divisible by `(a+b)(a-b)`
## *a<sup>m</sup>* + *b<sup>n</sup>*
- Is always divisible by `GCD(a,b)`
- *Eg: 333<sup>555</sup>+ 555<sup>333</sup> is always divisible by 111 and hence 37, and also by 3. Since, both terms are odd, also divisible by 2.*
---
## Power cycle 
- Last digit of *a<sup>n</sup>*
## Remainder cycle 
- Remainder when *a<sup>n</sup>* is divided by b

### Note:
- *For 5 alone remainder cycle not needed, last digit is sufficient*

## Number theory - Combinatorics
- Number of factors of a number from prime factorisation
- Sum of factors of a number 
- Number of factors of a number which are ***perfect squares***
    - Small modification of number of factors.

## LCM, GCD of fractions
- Numerator, Denominator separately.
## Applications of GCD, LCM
- Greatest, least number exactly divisible by a,b,c
- Greatest, least number divisible by a,b,c leaving same remainder
    - Greatest - `GCD(a-b,b-c,c-a)`
    - Least    - `LCM(a,b,c) + r`  *if r not smaller than a,b and c*
- Greatest, least number divisible by a,b,c leaving rem x,y,z
    - Greatest - `GCD(a-x,b-y,c-z)`
    - Least    - `LCM(a,b,c) - r` *only if r=a-x=b-y=c-z*
---
## NOTE:
- *Different Model: Successively dividing in order to give remainders a,b,c respectively.*
- Quotient is divided as a chain until specified.

### Tricky question: 
1. **The sum of the digits of a number N is 23. The remainder when N is divided by 11 is 7. What is the remainder when N is divided by 33?**
```
Sum of digits = 23
Remainder when N is divided by 9
N/9 = 5 {Remainder on division by 9 for any number
    is equal to the remainder of dividing the sum of the digits of the number by 9}
=> Remainder of N/3 = 2 {A number of the form 9k + 5 divided by 3 leaves a remainder 2}
N = 11k + 7
N = 3m + 2
11k + 7 => Possible numbers are 7, 18, 29, 40, 51
3m + 2 => Possible numbers are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29

The number that is of the form 11k + 7 and 3m + 2 should be of the form 33b + 29
```
