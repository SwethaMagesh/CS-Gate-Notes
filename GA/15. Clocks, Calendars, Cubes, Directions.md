## Clocks
### Angle between hour and min hand
- ***`|30h - 11m/2|`*** 
- Note: Negative if minute hand covers more distance
- ***Concept:***
    - Hour hand goes 30° in one hour and 1/2° every min
    - Minute hand goes 6° in one min
- 65 5/11 min additional for each hour
- Hour and minute hand 
    - ***coincide 22 times a day*** 
    - ***right angles 44 times a day***
- Mirror Image
	- For the reflection minute = 60 - given minute
	- Find the reflection hour = [12 - given hour - 1]
		- Eg: For 10, reflection hour = [12 - 10 -1] = 1

### Loss and Gain of Time
- Reference clock and Set clock
- If loss, ***`Correct time=Wrong time + lost time`***   
- If gain, ***`Correct time=Wrong time - gained time`*** 
- If the minute hand overtakes the hour hand at intervals of M minutes of correct time, the clock gains or loses in a day by ***`((720/11)-M)/M * 60 * 24 minutes`***

## Calendars
### Odd day calculation
- No. Of days more than the complete weeks are called odd days
	- For ordinary year = `365 - (52*7) = 1 day`
	- For leap year = `366 - (52*7) = 2 days`
	- For 100 years = `76 ordinary years + 24 leap years = (76*1) + (24*2) = 124 odd days = (124/7) = 17 weeks + 5 odd days` (Friday)
	- For 200 years = `5*2 = 10 = 1 week + 3 odd days` (Wednesday)
	- For 300 years = `5*3 = 15 = 2 weeks + 1 odd day` (Monday)
	- For 400 years = `5*4 + 1 = 21 = 0 odd days` (Sunday)
    - For N00 years = `N00%400 years' odd days`
- ***Note: Ending of a century is a cycle of Fri, Wed, Mon, Sun*** 
### Date calculation (2 Methods):
1. Simple - just split into century, year, month and date
1. Formulae - ***`date + (13M -1)//5 + Y//4 + Y + C//4 - 2C`*** 
    - Note: **M starts from March; Eg: Feb 2011 M=12, Y=10, C=20**

### Same calendar for 2 years
- y mod 4 = X
- ***Case X=0: Add 28***
- ***Case X=1: Add 6***
- ***Case X=2 or 3: Add 11***
#### Extras
-  Dooms days - last(28 or 29)/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12 - same day
-  Dooms day = constant + [Y/12] + rem + [rem/4]
    - Constant
        - 1800 to 1899 - Friday
		- 1900 to 1999 - Wednesday
		- 2000 to 2099 - Tuesday
        - 2100 to 2199 - Sunday
