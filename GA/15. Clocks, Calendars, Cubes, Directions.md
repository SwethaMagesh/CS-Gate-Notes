## Clocks
### Angle between hour and min hand
- ***`|30h - 11m/2|`*** 
- Note: Negative if minute hand covers more distance
- ***Concept:***
    - Hour hand goes 30° in one hour and 1/2° every min
    - Minute hand goes 6° in one min
- 65 5/11 min additional for each hour
- Hour and minute hand 
    - ***coincide 22 times a day*** 
    - ***right angles 44 times a day***
- Mirror Image
	- For the reflection minute = 60 - given minute
	- Find the reflection hour = [12 - given hour - 1]
		- Eg: For 10, reflection hour = [12 - 10 -1] = 1

### Longitude and Time
- Time is independent of **latitude**.
- Perform calculations only using longitude:
- Travelling direction:
	- Towards west (add the calculated time)
	- Towards east (subract the calculated time)	
- 360 degrees -> 24 hours
- 1 degree -> 4 mins
- Calculate the `degrees*4` and then add or sub.
- Don't forget to add the travelling time.

### Loss and Gain of Time
- Reference clock and Set clock
- If loss, ***`Correct time=Wrong time + lost time`***   
- If gain, ***`Correct time=Wrong time - gained time`*** 
- If the minute hand overtakes the hour hand at intervals of M minutes of correct time, the clock gains or loses in a day by ***`((720/11)-M)/M * 60 * 24 minutes`***

## Calendars
### Odd day calculation
- No. Of days more than the complete weeks are called odd days
	- For ordinary year = `365 - (52*7) = 1 day`
	- For leap year = `366 - (52*7) = 2 days`
	- For 100 years = `76 ordinary years + 24 leap years = (76*1) + (24*2) = 124 odd days = (124/7) = 17 weeks + 5 odd days` (Friday)
	- For 200 years = `5*2 = 10 = 1 week + 3 odd days` (Wednesday)
	- For 300 years = `5*3 = 15 = 2 weeks + 1 odd day` (Monday)
	- For 400 years = `5*4 + 1 = 21 = 0 odd days` (Sunday)
    - For N00 years = `N00%400 years' odd days`
- ***Note: Ending of a century is a cycle of Fri, Wed, Mon, Sun*** 
### Date calculation (2 Methods):
1. Simple - just split into century, year, month and date
1. Formulae - ***`date + (13M -1)//5 + Y//4 + Y + C//4 - 2C`*** 
    - Note: **M starts from March; Eg: Feb 2011 M=12, Y=10, C=20**

### Same calendar for 2 years
- y mod 4 = X
- ***Case X=0: Add 28***
- ***Case X=1: Add 6***
- ***Case X=2 or 3: Add 11***
#### Extras
-  Dooms days - last(28 or 29)/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12 - same day
-  Dooms day = constant + [Y/12] + rem + [rem/4]
    - Constant
        - 1800 to 1899 - Friday
		- 1900 to 1999 - Wednesday
		- 2000 to 2099 - Tuesday
        - 2100 to 2199 - Sunday

## Cubes

### Type 1 
- Several views of a complete cube are given and you have to find which part of the cube lies exactly below a particular part
	- Assume X occurs with A and B. And Y also occurs with A and B. Then X and Y are opposite to each other.
	- Assume X occurs with Y and Z. Suppose Y and Z don't appear together in any more views, but they appear separately in two or more different views. Then the common figure in which Y and Z appear separately, will be the figure opposite to X.
	- Assume two images has X, the opposite figure is the one which doesn't occur in any of the four figures with X in two images.
### Type 2 
- An opened up cube is given and you have to predict what it will looks like when it is closed into a cube.
### Type 3
- A cube has 6 faces, 12 edges and 8 corners
- Total number of cubes (small ones) - n^3
- No of cubes with
	- Three sides painted = always 8 (corner cubes)
	- Two sides painted = 12 * (n-2) 
	- One side painted = 6 * (n-2)^2 
	- Zero side painted = (n-2)^3 
### Type 4
- From the give images, predict the correct one
### Type 5
- For the given number of cuts, max number of identical pieces obtained
	- (L+1)(B+1)(H+1)
	- Eg: 5 cuts -> (2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 18
- For the given number of cuts (N), min number of identical pieces obtained
	- (N+1)
	- Eg: 5 cuts -> 5+1 = 6
- Given N identical pieces, find the number of cuts
	- Take cube root, N^(1/3)
	- Subtract one
	- Multiply by 3
