## Relative Fractions
```
- 50%      - 1/2
- 33.33%   - 1/3 
- 25%      - 1/4
- 20%      - 1/5  
- 16.66%   - 1/6
- 14.28%   - 1/7
- 12.5%    - 1/8
- 11.11%   - 1/9
- 9.09%    - 1/11 
- 8.33%    - 1/12     
```
*Note:* 
- Use nine multiples like `36.36 as 4/11` 
- Split and work `58.33 as 1/2 plus 1/12 or 1/4 plus 1/3`
## Successive Percentages
- a%, then b% is `(a + b + ab/100)`
- Increase is +a and decrease is -a
---
## Back to Original
- ***First increase, then decrease =>***  *1/n increase, then 1/(n+1) decrease*
- ***First decrease, then increase =>***  *1/n increase, then 1/(n-1) increase*

## Simple Interest
- Each year, Interest=`r % of P`
- ***Shortcut*** : `(n x r) % of P` 
---
## Compound Interest
- ***METHOD 1*** : Formula =>
`P (1 + r/100)`<sup>`n`</sup>  
- ***METHOD 2*** : Amount each year=>
`Amount after n years = Amt after (n-1) years + r% of A`<sub>`n-1`</sub> 
- ***METHOD 3*** : Interest for each year=>
`Interest for nth year = Interest for (n-1)th year + r% of I`<sub>`n-1`</sub>

## Relation between SI and CI
- Pascal Triangle method
- *Beware r denotes r% -> /100 is implicit*
