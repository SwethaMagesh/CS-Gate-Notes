## Time, speed and distance
- If one of them is constant, equate immediately
- Difference in parameter to form equation
- *Note: Unit is important. 1kmph=5/18mps*
---
### Average speed
- `Total distance/ Total time`
- Weighted average of speeds with time as weights
- *IF time is constant, Average speed= `(s1+s2)/2`* 
- *IF distance is constant, Average speed= `2s1s2/(s1+s2)`*
- *Trivia:* If speed is constant, Average speed=Speed

### Relative speed 
- ***Best application*** - Chase someone, trains crossing each other
- Non contact separate bodies
- Relative speed 
    - ***Same direction:*** `s1-s2`
    - ***Opposite direction:*** `s1+s2`
- ***Train problems:***
    - Cross a stationary pole/man `Train length/Train speed` 
    - Cross a bridge or tunnel `(Train length+ Bridge length)/ Train speed` 
    - Cross a running man/car
    `Train length/Relative speed` 
    - Cross another running train
    `(Train1 length+Train2 length)/ Relative speed`

### Effective Speed
- ***Best application:*** Boats and streams, down a escalator
- Contact bodies, force acts on same body
- Effective speed 
    - ***Same direction:*** `s1+s2`
    - ***Opposite direction:*** `s1-s2`
- ***Boats and Streams***
    - `Downstream - faster (boat+water)`  
    - `Upstream - slower (boat-water)`

### Races, Linear and Circular Tracks
- Beat by distance 
- Beat by time
- Headstart distance
- Headstart time
- Dead heat
