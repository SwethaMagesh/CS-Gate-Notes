## Different efficiencies
- Fraction method 
- Units method (eg. Chocolates)
    - *Eg: A does in 15 days, B does in 10 days*  
    ```
    - LCM = 30 => Total work units: 30
    - A in one day => 30/15 => 2 units
    - B in one day => 30/10 => 3 units
    - In one day together   => 5 units
    - No of days   => 30/5  => 6 days
    ```
    

## Pipes and Cisterns
- Destructive work too.

## Mandays 
- *No of men x No of days = CONSTANT*
- ***(m<sub>1</sub> x d<sub>1</sub> x h<sub>1</sub>)/w<sub>1</sub> = (m<sub>2</sub> x d<sub>2</sub> x h<sub>2</sub>)/w<sub>2</sub>***
