# Eigen Values & Matrices concepts: 
## Facts
1. “Eigen-vectors of a real symmetric matrix are orthogonal(perpendicular).”
2. "Eigen values of a symmetric matrix are real"
  ```
  The Spectral Theorem states that if A is an n×n symmetric matrix with real entries,
  then it has n orthogonal eigenvectors. 
  The first step of the proof is to show that 
  all the roots of the characteristic polynomial of A (i.e. the eigenvalues of A) are real numbers.
  ```
3. All the orthogonal matrices are symmetric in nature. ??? (sym or skew ?) Doubt
4. The determinant of an orthogonal matrix is always ±1
4. Every entry of an orthogonal matrix must be between 0 and 1.
5. If the eigenvalues of an orthogonal matrix are all real, then the eigenvalues are
always ±1
6. No of linearly independent Eigen vectors= no of distinct (different ) Eigen values
7.

## PYQ which are worth noting
